            Are you interested in dipping your toes into the design system
            world, but feel overwhelmed about where to start? How do I build a
            component system in Figma? How do I translate that into code? What
            about managing the complexity as those change over time? Don't
            forget, you're building a toolkit for the rest of your team so you
            need to document how the whole thing works!

            all in this coure. You're gonna walk away confident that you can
